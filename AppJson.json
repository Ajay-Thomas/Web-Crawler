{"Name": "Mind Games Pro", "Description": "Exercise Your Brain! This is the unlimited, ad-free, version of the hit brain training app.  Mind Games is a great collection of games based in part on principles derived from cognitive tasks to help you practice different mental skills.  This app includes all of Mindware\u2019s brain exercising games.  All games include your score history and graphs of your progress.  The main app shows a summary of your best games and today\u2019s scores on all games.  Using some principles of standardized testing, your scores are also converted to a comparison scale so that you can see where you need work and excel.  The Training Center selects games for you to play in order to maximize your progress and enjoyment.  Mind Games incorporates Mindfulness exercises.  Previous research has shown that Mindfulness may provide improvements in focus, working memory, and mental flexibility for some.  Research indicates that there may also be emotional benefits of Mindfulness.  The app  provides instruction on how to use Mindfulness during game play and in your life.  Other activities are recommended that previous research suggests may help cognition for some  (such as aerobic exercise).  You may also learn new memory strategies.  No scientific research has yet been conducted to determine if the app\u2019s particular implementation of Mindfulness and brain training games has cognitive benefits.  At a minimum you can have fun challenging your mind with our games, learning a new meditation practice, learning about strategies that may enhance your retention of information, and gaining knowledge in the knowledge-based activities.Mind Games is also now available on iPhone/iPad and Windows.Languages available: English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Russian, Japanese.", "Review 0": " Wonderful app, but I have one request Please change some of the sounds that occurs when you make several correct choices in a row.

Highly recommended. Marvellous endless running game. Challenging and addictive. Collect a variety of characters, search for treasure, and wear the hats! The game now comprises 3 maps. The original Sky Summit is the classic track, while Frozen Shadows adds extra challenges of falling bricks, ice slides and a temple monster who meets you head-on!

Some of the tasks set from level 9 are not achievable and would require you to spend a lot of money to help you along or play for a long while. For example needing 500 gems to unlock a level. We all know there not frequent enough to have that many by level 9 and use them to upgrade players abilities.

I like the new frosty version  and the Scorching Sands version you added to Temple Run 2 also.The Halloween version is great but have a suggestion.... instead of a toxic waste water run you might go with a spooky swamp theme.

The very next morning a new update was available and I was able to open the game with everything intact.

So, after scanning whatever I needed to scan I had so much fun deleting photos from the phone's gallery, dropbox, onedrive, and google drive that I can't wait to scan something else. Also, the app's built-in camera crops too much from the bottom of the page. Please fix it.  Full Review  ", "Review 1": " Shots not so clear but many features you can still use I use Camscanner to scan A2 drawings as I'm in engineering field but the result is not so clear (even if I explored different camera blending) as compared to Turboscan. However. I like other features though such as QR code and OCR reader which other App doesn't. I wish they could improve the scanning itself as this is the main features of this App.  Full Review  ", "Review 2": "  This is a wonderful scanner app. and an extremely useful tool.  I scan all kinds of documents and as such this tool has become indispensable to me.  It auto focuses when you scan a document and then finds the boundaries of it  perfectly.  It will crop it and also give you a chance to modify the crop.  Next, the biggest feature for me, it will let you save the document to black and white so that you don't waste a lot of ink when you print it.  I had a question and emailed the developer who got back to me with a detailed explanation of what to do, included photos of how to do it.  Can't ask for any better!  I highly recommend the CamScanner app.  Full Review  ", "Review 3": " Best app for homework My fellow students who cant afford books love it when they get a pdf file from me on our current chaprer. This app is a life saver.  I scann my 19 lb book and read it anywhere. The Text is enhanced and looks better than the hard copy!  The add on search feature makes it so easy to search and edit. I'd give it 10 stars It was possible.  Full Review  ", "Review 4": " Beautifull app So you are wondering if the paid version of this app is worth it. If the free version is a very good scanner that organizes your documents in digital form editing them cropping them enchancing them etc, the paid version is 10 times better without the watermark at the bottom  no ads and a bunch of options like uploading to other apps like evernote dropbox making an account etc etc.. its a must have application which I got today 12-1-2015 and im very happy about it cause its the best app in google play.  Full Review  ", "Review 5": " Great app!  But..... I first installed the free version.  Then the premium with the license key for $.99 which I purchased;  it did NOT give me the premium app. I emailed the support team and nothing,  NO response!  I went online also to see if I did not do something right.  I did everything right.  I hope that you respond to us.  We pay you.  It's not right! !!  I know we can call Google for a refund,  but I want this premium app. You're having a sale on the premium for $.99. Please fix.  Thank you!  Full Review  ", "Review 6": " LOVE THIS APP! Literally could not manage without this. Had for years, paid for license so no ads and it's invaluable.

Love the upgrade. Thanks!  Full Review  ", "Review 7": "  Bought the app immediately, but then found i cant share scans using third party mail apps. Tried with standard mail - ok, tried with different scanning software - upload with third patry software is ok too. The only way i can upload the scan is using 'email to myself' but this is not what you want to pay for. Dear developers please comment this issue. Thank you  Full Review  ", "Review 8": " Awesome! Works as described, been using the free app for a few years and decided to buy as they keep improving and making it better...

I then updated to the Pro version, I take lots of pictures of yards & Contracts because of my work. I Sell Artificial Turf. This is a fantastic app for me. IMHO. I have one question, I used to have the standard app and the Pro version on my Samsung Galaxy S4 screen. Now I only have 1. It works fine. In my downloaded files both are still there. Did you guys just put both of mine in 1 now?

Full Review  ", "Review 11": " Was better before the recent update I liked the previous version, 5 stars, but the update removed the status indicator, at least for Dropbox. Now if I scan several documents and then upload them I have to check to make sure they were successful before I delete them from the app or I could lose the scans. I wrote them about this and got a disappointing, barely English, response that did not address my questions. If they fix this I'd be happy to change my rating to 5 stars.

Thats a basic feature,  and forcing registration  for paid customers is pure extortion\u2026.  End Update.   bought the full app,  well worth supporting such a great product.

I hope I can continue using the app with a prompt response and a solution.  Full Review  ", "Review 16": " Remarkable and Productive I have been using the upgraded version for awhile now. Clearly, I'm impressed and far more productive. I didn't even realize that you can send faxes! Only a few days ago, did I decide to compare it to \"Office Lens\". Because, I see that you can directly add scans to several Office Products. For now - just a comparison; I love CamScanner. I hope to return to give my results.  Full Review  ", "Review 17": "  I am entirely happy with this app.  I work mostly out of my truck.  The ability to scan a page, the send via text/email is most convenient.  I would suggest to the developer, give us the ability to \"FAX\" a document, as well as email.  It's the only thing missing. An additional fee naturally would be fair.  But, I get more use from this app than any other I have.  Your needs may be different. But if you use it, I hope you'll find it as useful as I do.  Full Review  ", "Review 18": " Essential ***For the full version*** An essential app, saved my life several times (lol not literally).

I downloaded it and came to the same conclusion very quickly.   The quality of scanning is excellent and the flexibility and number of options are very impressive.   I bought the premium version almost immediately and frankly it's a steal at the price.   Well done devs!  Full Review  ", "Review 20": " Paid for subscription once long before but the features are removed due to their new subscription feature Look i understand that you got popular and want to make more money, but you can't do this by screwing old users! I paid ~5$  long before and just wanted high resolution scanning, nothing more. Now i can't do that apparently i have to pay monthly subscription for what i paid before. This is not nice, i don't like companies/developers that don't honor their own promise. What If i buy your monthly subscription and you decided to switch to weekly one! Not recommended at all.  Full Review  ", "Review 21": " No Dropbox sync I just want to scan with ocr, export to pdf and sync to Dropbox. But they won't allow it because they want to sell you their services.

Also, wondering why you can backup your pdfs to gmail and other third parties, yet that isn't possible with camcard business card scanner pro.  but, it's great as is. I don't know how the developer manages to adjust the white balance so perfectly when I have to use photo-editing applications for oft-times inferior results. I haven't tried capturing text with OCR yet, btw, but I'm confident that it is at least as good as the business card app.  Thanks to the developer!

HI, I bought the pro version, and pressing OCR brings up error saying my phone does not allow installing apps from untrusted source. I know how to turn it off but I won't.    If your app is legitimate, and not MALWARE, it should NOT require installing apps from untrusted sources. Please explain why the scanning function cannot be included with the app and needs to be installed from your website.    I pay for my apps on Google Play for security and peace of mind.

Full Review  ", "Review 29": " Fast way to create PDF documents to share or import to other apps First let me say this  license is NOT the premium version and only unlocks a few additional features as listed in the description. So read carefully.  This is a simple app and the document management only support tagging. There are no folders or any other organizational features. This works fine if you don't have a many documents as you have to search keywords and you can filter by the tags. There is web based access to the documents synced. The scanner part does have good options to adjust settings, color, etc. when items are scanned. Also images taking by the camera and stored in the gallery, or from your other cloud services can be pulled in allowing you to take quick photos to create documents later.  Full Review  ", "Review 30": " SCAM Scanner Upgraded to the paid version because I need the OCR. This does not seem to have it. Therefore, they appear to be misrepresenting their product.

In the app it states that buying this will upgrade you to premium and that its currently on sale.

MC5 is definitely the closest you'll get to a console-level fps experience on a mobile. Multiplayer mode is amazing. Sound and graphics are top-notch, weapons customization is nice too.

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of several thousand ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions Flightradar24, with the help of multilateration, is able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don\u2019t have ADS-B transponders.Traditional radar data is also used in the app thanks to a direct feed from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). http://www.flightradar24.com/how-it-works***IMPORTANT NOTICES***Minimum required screen resolution is 320x480px.If you are only interested in tracking air traffic in a specific region, we suggest that you check Flightradar24.com BEFORE purchasing the app. Flightradar24 provides unrivaled positional aircraft data coverage around the world but there are areas where we don\u2019t have coverage. Overview of coverage as of January 2016:* Europe: close to 100%* North America: 100% of US and Canada via slightly delayed radar data.

On the whole i prefer this app over any of the others but i think the developers need to address missing flights that users are pysically staring at. I understand military aircraft aren't captured but if users are paying for upgraded apps, the development of this app is way overdue.  Full Review  ", "Review 1": " I Like this App! This is a great app!  But it's missing 2 things that would make it the perfect app.  I had to get another app to see a map of airports.  If those airport maps were included here, where I could see gates from landing to my next take off, that would be perfect!  The 2nd thing, the flight alerts need a date field.  When family comes to visit, I could put the info in the alert and be done! As it is now, I have to hear the alert everyday until their flight day. Need a date field! Great app, love the 3D!  Full Review  ", "Review 2": " Geeking out I've been using this app for loooong time now and still love it. UX and features are pretty solid. Wouldn't drastically change anything, just keep improving the features you have and feel free to add new (paid) features. Yes, paid. I don't mind paying for great stuff if you give me the option to choose what I'm paying for:)  Full Review  ", "Review 3": " Developer listen up Yesterday i was looking straight above at 2 aircraft crossing over near each other. Yet the app said there were no planes within 100 miles of Sheffield - b.s. It has been useless for some time now. I also paid for the upgraded plane icons. They're gone too. If not fixed by monday 13th june 2016, in 1 week from now, i'll be uninstalling and getting a refund.  Full Review  ", "Review 4": " Great app I'm addicted.  It's fascinating to discover what is flying above me.  I had no idea we have SO many aircraft flying over us - the aircraft noise was an indicator I guess!   We're on the direct flight path of two major airports.  At the very least this app has been the deciding factor in me wanting to move house!  Have got a couple of in-app purchases which makes it even more interesting.  Full Review  ", "Review 5": " Missing flight traffic I purchased this app because I live in a moderately high aircraft traffic area. Although, a great number of overhead and nearby aircraft that are visible or heard - are not listed nor detected via the in-app AR. I've expanded the options to their most broad settings in an attempt to capture anything, to no avail. The flights the app is not tracking is on going, are at varying elevations, speeds, and from the past few weeks. I don't live next to an Airforce base or anything what may have so many unregistered  Full Review  ", "Review 6": " Great app, but not as much data as the iOS version. I love this app for tracking flights into and out of my local GA airport. It's especially fun when used with a handheld transceiver or something like LiveATC. Sadly, the Android version is missing several smaller airports where I live, which were available in the iOS version. Would love to see them added.  Full Review  ", "Review 7": " FANTASTIC APPLICATION ~ Infinite Fun With all the games and various Apps, this has to be my favorite, especially when you pair it with \ud83c\udf90 LIVE ATC app. In doing so, you can tweak things a bit and  listen to the Aircraft your following. I paid for all the extras. \u2708\ud83d\ude81  I'm everything  Aviation. I assure you it's worth the purchase.$\ud83d\udcb5 In fact some News Agencies use it. I saw it on one using it to track the Russian Spy Plane returning to Russia from Syria, (Feb 2016). Forgive me, as I can't recall the News Agency, nor the exact date. Google it!\ud83d\ude00  Full Review  ", "Review 8": " Great app Living near an airport, I've always wondered what make and model the different planes are that I see landing and taking off, as well as where their coming from and going.  This app gives me all that and more.  The only thing I would like added to it is a night mode toggle, (similar to the ones you get in astronomy apps), as the screen is too bright at night.  (You can dim the map in settings, but I would prefer a dedicated night mode).  Full Review  ", "Review 9": " Best App I've ever used!!! This app by far surpasses any app I've ever used and worth every penny. I absolutely love it and find myself opening the app every free chance I get! It's sooooo much fun to learn about all the different flights. I had not realized how many are flying at one given moment! WOW!  I also love the 3D features, so awesome to see what each plane is flying over. The alerts and or 'squak alerts' are very interesting as well. I love EVERYTHING about this app! Hats off to the creators, well done!!!!!  Full Review  ", "Review 10": " Was a great app and now it does not work. I paid for this app 2 years ago and had no problem reinstalling the app on a new phone without paying for it again. But now they require a login and account with them that I have never been asked to setup, have no option to setup and am at a loss. If you force new requirements on your app purchasers, you need to give them the means to continue accessing what they paid for.  Full Review  ", "Review 11": " Upgrade wth? I used to love this app & use it everyday. Its one of the best Apps ever but what have you done to it? Since downloading the update you cant retract the map back in after expanding it. You click on an aircraft and it doesnt identify it correctly anymore. I clicked on a Adel to Dubai flight & it said Royal Flying Doctor Service???Please fix make it like it was before or I will delete it.  Full Review  ", "Review 12": " Cool app If your an aviation buff and you want to know the ID of that airplane above you,where it's going and where did it come from then this app's for you. This app works very well with little trouble. Tons more features, I bought the add-ons they work well also. When my friends see it they down load it. They love it too. Get it.  Full Review  ", "Review 13": "  This app is definately worth its weight. I looked at a few others before chosing it but feel I made the right choice. The are  some in app purchases that really make it shine depending on your needs but its good to go without those. Although I would mention I have read that there is a flight playback feature  for desktops not offered in the app. Truth? Rumor? I would be nice to have that included in app.  Full Review  ", "Review 14": "  A great app that provides in depth information on any flight,  if you have the paid version.  If you have a Chromecast you can share the map to your TV, too,  but here's why I haven't given 5 stars: the cast only shares a map. It doesn't highlight the plane you're tracking,  nor the flight's data. This is still displayed on the tablet, but would be much better sharing screen real estate on the casted screen!  Full Review  ", "Review 15": " Needs multiple entries per filter Love the app.  Would rate a 5 * if I were able to filter multiple airlines or airports or aircraft types. For example; I would love to filter out all of Air Canada's regional carriers as well as the mainline carrier on one display.  Similarly, if I can see all traffic between JFK AND LHR.  Web site allows these types of combinations but this app sadly does not.  Full Review  ", "Review 16": " Pretty good but 1 minor issue Apps works very well. Can't complain at all about the app itself.I paid for the PRO version and i don't really like that there are more in-app purchases available. You should pay once and have all features of the app. Not buying one version then having to pay for other features to be unlocked.  Full Review  ", "Review 17": " Not picking up many planes I used this app this afternoon as a number of flights were taking off from Dublin Airport and flying directly over my area. I could ckearly see that they were either Ryanair or Aer Lingus flights, but none registered when I pointed the phone up at them to test this app. Not impressed. I'm now questioning whether it is accurately identifying aircraft at all.  Full Review  ", "Review 18": " Accurate but chromecast function is poor I have compared this app to others and it seems to update much more frequently and track much more accurately. Unfortunately when casting to my TV it will work but lose connection when switching back and forth with shuffle. Once connection is lost it won't connect again without a phone restart  Full Review  ", "Review 19": " Ordinary! I was disappointed to PAY for all the extras on this app, and NOT to receive my set 'alerts'/additional info and to find the flight i was tracking was out of  FlightRadar24 detection area, when so many other flights from the same region and/or airline were showing up. Personally it made me question the information i was being given by the app. I feel i should've just stayed with the free version. I've been disappointed by it.  Full Review  ", "Review 20": " Poor user interface Here are some improvements that I can think of: 1. the search tool is quite inconsistent. Some flight number doesn't appear when you search it but you'll find it if you look for it from the flight by airline list. 2. The list of \"Airport By Country\" and \"Flight by Airline\" will be better if you can type to search our filter. 3. The \"Flight by Airline\" is not entirely in alphabetical order.  Full Review  ", "Review 21": " almost perfect I've been having an issue with two minor things, one being the map is always black, and the other is the older planes aren't tracked so well, as an example I missed a 727 and a 737-200 since I didn't know it's heading, is it because of the age of the aircraft that it makes it difficult to track or because of the owner of the plane doesn't want it to be tracked?  Full Review  ", "Review 22": "  Amazing coverage compared to its competitors. Aircraft icons are not accurate e.g. the A330-B767-B787 all look alike (a bit disappointed to pay for an option and be limited; it's free and more accurate in Plane Finder). Chromecast connection is great. It is my favorite flight tracking app and I strongly recommend it to anyone passionate about civil aviation. + I just upgraded to get the alert system. 4.5 euro for something so basic, it is not worth it. I will send a mail to suggest how to improve because it's really too limited and tricky to use.  Full Review  ", "Review 23": " Great!! Really helpful and exciting app.. Since my childhood, I used to stare at planes that pass over my head and wonder where they all were going!! Thanks to technology, Flightradar24 and its crew. Now its just a child's play to know almost all critical details of such aircrafts!!! I really am enjoying tracking and sneaking almost all aircrafts that fly near my locality!! Big Thanks to you guys!!!  Full Review  ", "Review 24": " poor paid additions and additional charges even for paid version a useful app (hence 2 stars purely for functionality) as i work at an airport as security  and tracking inbound flights can be useful for helping customers and being there prompltly before the planes arrive. however i bought the pro version and now apparently have to still pay for additional add ons you dont buy a car then have to pay for the engine and wheels. if you wont add all the features to the pro version dont offer a pro version i guess you guys are money over customers. i want my money back :/  Full Review  ", "Review 25": " Not sure if im using it correctly. Usining the app shows a great deal of aircraft how the ones Im actually trying to track for some reason dont show up at all. The company shows up on the airlines list but I do not get indication that any of the aircraft are enroute when i actually know they are. Maybe someone can help me so my money isnt wasted...  Full Review  ", "Review 26": " Can not Remove the photo of Plane The photo of an airliner at the lower right corner is covering more than 20% of the screen area! Irritating! Can not be turned off!

Full Review  ", "Review 27": " Not worth the money... uninstalled after half day. Whats with the in app purchases. I have paid for the app already.... how much more you want ? In app purchases is ridiculous. Icon pack really? That should be in there by default. I didn't have to pay to get a nice looking icons for planes. It's a total overpriced in app purchase ripoff. Do not recommend..  Full Review  ", "Review 28": " Very handy Easy to use. I often wondered where planes were going or where they came from. Now I can see . It is also very handy when you are either travelling or picking somebody up from the airport knowing exactly when the plane will land or take off or where your friends or family are when in the air.  Full Review  ", "Review 29": " Interesting and fun I've noticed a flight path over our home especially in the evening sky for years.  I always wondered where the flight was from and where it was going.  I found this app yesterday and it answered all my questions and more.   It's amazing to see how many planes are in the sky at any given time.  Full Review  ", "Review 30": " Frustration frustration Works occationally just so you keep trying. It will just go \"POP\" and you are lost again with a screen you don't need or recognise. It is just too weird and unpredictable to be of any practical use \"on the go\" unless you enjoy mental torture and agonising frustration. I have never come across anything as \"screen-jumpy\" and volatile like this Flighradar app... and i paid for it!!!  Full Review  ", "Review 31": "  I had a problem where I would not get any 747 on my filter when I checked on my phone app. Lucky another user told me to reinstall, and it worked. Someone had asked as they were following BA 747. That's all you have to do, and I didn't loose  my extra app purchase's. Its now all good. just wanted to share .  Full Review  ", "Review 32": " Really nice - but a suggestion A terrific app,  useful & fascinating if you're following someone 's flight. One annoying thing though -  when you search for a flight, and it shows the map of the current position, it leaves the other info up, thus obscuring much of the map. If you dismiss the info panel, it loses the focus on the flight of interest. Irritating bit of app design...  Full Review  ", "Review 33": " Good, but hide other in-app purchases I decided to pay for the app exclusively to check my flight delays based in the airport I am. And as soon as I paid and installed the app I found out that I had to pay more to release the function I was looking for. That information should be available at the very beginning =/ sad \ud83d\ude14  Full Review  ", "Review 34": " Terrible Re purchased  this app for my new phone. Had it before on another phone and it was brill. But this time it is crap. When I track a plane I get nothing. It's way off target. Your getting my money for something that is not working. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND QUICK.  Full Review  ", "Review 35": " Fabulous. Informative and time saving. This app takes the guess work out of when you have to leave home to coordinate a pick up.  It shows accurately where the flight is at any time and information about the plane itself. I now can't imagine being without this clever app.  Full Review  ", "Review 36": "  The free version of this app works really well (apart from the adverts). This paid version cant even load a map screen and reports server errors on the same phone and internet connection that the free version uses.  I have de-installed the paid version.

The game is mildly amusing when you're in the dentist's waiting room or having a lengthy, post-Chipotle toilet visit, but don't expect the game to play fair. Their agenda is to take your money and they do this by frustrating you massively in the hope you buy items to help you defeat the games blatantly rigged mechanics.

The story is average, just Lara Croft minding her own business going to the old relics and stuff. The graphic itself is greatly optimized, I managed to get 60 FPS without any stutter.

So they put deals on the store, overpriced gems to get then. 100 dollars in gems gets you nearly 2 or 3 good chest at the max, which you still only have low chance of getting anything you already don't have.

I'm a f2p player with the worst legendaries (sparky and lava hound) and I have he ice wiz that I don't even use.  However, the game's balancing makes it so u can still make it really high without legendaries (3300 trophies lvl 9 with trifecta).

And that is we can set the limit of each card type level. For example, I can set the common card limit to level 10 so when I play with my friends, my common cards are level 10 and lower.

The app loads quickly, very quick and casual gameplay but it has a lot of depth also. You start with 8 very basic cards and slowly build your deck and gain stronger cards in each arena. The gameplay is simple, use the cards you have to destroy the opposing teams towers; while they are trying to do the same to you.

Simply, you'll have a good deck to deal with almost anything, until the player you're up against just so happens to have legendary cards, or cards from the next arena.

Developing a game with general public in mind they should have realized that people enjoy the beautiful unique military aircraft and stunt planes that we so regularly see.

Honestly I truly enjoy it. My Suggestion to you is if possible can you add bit more options when we field. Example, I played a PC game in which there was an option to operate fielder for catches. Whenever the opponent hit for a catch, there use to be a small circle shown next to fielder and the gamer needs to tap on it on right time to hold the catch. If wrong tap catch is dropped. Thanks for the Game  Full Review  ", "Review 5": " Good For test match, scenario it would be good, if the opponent team bowls on its own . Right now we need to set lengths and select bowlers ourselves from the opponent team  and then do the batting. Also can you  make field setting manual and not customise it.

Overall , a good experience and fantastic graphics.  Full Review  ", "Review 6": " For an older version It is actually to hard to play. When we play and make a good score in batting then when the other team members hit sixes in whatever ball we give like short ball off spin leg spin full good length off swing in swing and others.

Not ro mention that once tou do spend some money they will start only offering $100 packs to you. Isnthe game fun, yes it was.

When you pay money for things like cue shots will go in no matter what. Same exact shots won't make it for those who do not spend money. I tried with 2 different accounts. Try not to pay any money cause it won't do you good unless you keep spending. And whats with that daily spin? Its 100 most of the times and 250 on occasions. I don't think anyone gets a high price. So why all the deception? Just give 100 to players every day.  Full Review  ", "Review 24": " Realistic except for... Fun and realistic game. Call shot feature of foul when ball pocketed in wrong pocket is terrible and should have been fixed by now. Needs \"safe shot\" capability.

The best thing is you can practice in offline mode to experiment with different tactics to pocket the balls. A nice time killer game !!

One small criticism would be that when you win a round and you return to the choose location menu it automatically shifts you to the one you can afford, which can result in you losing most of your coins if you're not paying proper attention.  It's stitched me up a couple of times!!!  Full Review  ", "Review 28": " Yuukkkk No proper connection, from two weeks I am loosing my coins without playing.

I mean, it could use some performance and battery improvements. But still awesome! Edit: minus one star because Radio X and Radio Los Santos both play literally nothing but commercials.

I've played every GTA game they've made, except the ones on PS Vita. Now I can play GTA Vice City & San Andreas on my phone! Funny, back in the day, the game needed a PS2 computer game console and this game maxed out it's processor. Now my phone is far more powerful than the console, with way faster loading times.

It could certainly be better, but overall it's still loads of fun to play.  Full Review  ", "Review 25": " Great! Few bugs A huge sandbox to explore and follow through an interesting story, with a character that physically adapts to your playstyle by leveling up skills you use, IN MY POCKET.

Other than that it plays smooth.  Full Review  ", "Review 26": " Unquestionably a brilliant game and completely true to the original PC version. No lag using a Samsung Galaxy S4. I would have put 6 stars if this were possible. However difficult to control vehicles, so a wider range of control options should be implemented and designed very carefully. I haven't experimented with the different options for controlling vehicles, but it is much easier to play on the PC which means completing some missions is very difficult.

Now I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7 and a steelseries controller. The game seems playable however you still don't have the ability to map your own buttons. It also doesn't follow the original Xbox controller layout even though you're basically using an Xbox controller.

Works pretty good with the dual shock 3 controller. Buttons are a little backwards but plays almost like the original PS2 game.

This game kept and even improved the graphical fidelity of the PS2. Runs pretty well maxed out on my zenfone 2 with a few framerate drops here and there.

On Xbox you get a dodge and enable bullet time manually per button.  To have it all in one button for this port makes it difficult to play because you don't want to do certain movements.  Anyway to give us options to configure the game controller buttons?  Make it like the original where one action is define per button.

However touch screen gaming as always sucks so I deleted it, and upon purchasing the moga pocket controller I hoped this game would eventually be supported.  Now they have added moga support but many functions are not mapped to the buttons, including the ability to shoot. I think this is because they added moga pro support only. Add moga pocket support please until then this is 1*!

Get in your truck and deliver cargo to your destination.", "Review 0": " Great game, needs to be expanded 5 stars when you expand the scenery, which is very realistic looking but needs to change a lot more from stage to stage so the game doesn't get monotonous; make trucks more realistic looking too. Use a point system linked to the time it takes you to finish a stage. You could even put fuel barrels to be picked up along the way, make it the next Hill Climb Racing, use you imagination! It's OK though. But why can't the trucks not fall all the way down to the bottom and blow up? It's called Shock Value!

Our company, Lightricks, has shifted focus to iOS apps for several reasons. In the past year, we've been working on a new photo editing app called Enlight.

I was pleasantly surprised that this app did this as well. That's why I unlocked the program, to support app developers that actually create great apps.

The push for iap is huge, and playing it it's incredibly annoying.  At best it's playable for 10 minutes every other hour and at times even days. Coming up with other way for revenue would be great such as an ad banner when going to a menu. Non intrusive and money making too  Full Review  ", "Review 1": " Awesome Game I love this game a lot. I am addicted to it. Everything is good but it would be more better if, the COC team adds a feature in this game and that is to collect whatever required gold or elixirs from the treasury. For example, if I want to collect only 1,00,000 gold than there must be a feature to collect only the required gold and not the whole treasure and the rest is safe in the treasury. Hope you like my idea. Else everything is fine. Thank You for such a beautiful game. God bless the developers of game.  Full Review  ", "Review 2": " Good game but need a but improvement Am playing this game more than a year. Its best strategic and addictive game but there are some issues that should be resolved. One of main issues are upgrade taking so much time, wall upgrade cost should be reduced and there should be some source that constantly generate or produce gems. And please please no more unwanted upgrades. Please seriously consider thses suggestions. I put my precious time in it. Thank you  Full Review  ", "Review 3": " It just keeps getting better The newest update really spiced up the game. However, more campaign missions are needed including new missions with Dark Elixer rewards. Been 4 years since they touched campaign. Also, people plz listen to me: Gems are a privilege, not an obligation. They are not a normal resource within the game like gold or Elixer as some might think. Gems are how Supercell make money to pay their team and there should never be a gem mine or anything that generates free gems other than what is already in the game.

No. They merely allow you to progress faster and I'm fine with that. You still can't buy skill.  Full Review  ", "Review 8": " Great game The game is great.

Pokemon is the best game I've ever played. This comes close to Pokemon but not close enough. That's why I rated this game 4 stars. 1 problem I've thought of is lack of gems. There are only few chances to earn gems. In my opinion  there must be a gem mine or whatever which can produce gems. It must be like 3,5,10 gems per day or whatever. If this comes,it will be a superb game.  Full Review  ", "Review 11": " Great game It is addictive and can fully understand why it's so popular.

It works well and has a lot of options for power users. It also allows you to back and restore which is a real bonus when you have to wipe your phone, or if switching from one phone to another saving you lots of time. It's not 100% perfect but it probably is closest to that than any other Android launcher. I have the paid version to support the developers but the free version is also very good.

Using Nova I can give my devices the same look and feel. I love the App Drawer and the extra config options. I can now run everything off 3 home screens. I recommend trying Nova if you have multiple devices, it greatly improves my Android experience and battery life is not compromised. 18 months on very stable,  no issues,  brilliant.

It just ruined the whole launcher. Everything else amazing. You have so much to customize. But u can't even put the apps in the order that you want. Bought the prime version thinking it might be a prime feature but I was wrong. Even the stock launcher has this function. I mean you would just assume nova would. If you bring can do it with the next update then u get 5stars.

I want to change my setting menu background color to dark so it's easy on the eyes and less power consuming. It doesnt seem any app offers this with out using exposed though which is not currently compatible with my version of android so poo.

We noticed that it is somehow connected to Nova Launcher's double tap to lock gesture of which after you double tap to turn off the screen, if you try to wake the V10 up with either the power button or double tap, 95% of the time the fingerprint unlock will not show up but whatever you set as the secondary lock would (pattern, pin, tap, etc). But if we revert back to the stock LG UX launcher, the fingerprint to unlock prompt always work.  Kindly look into this as the fingerprint unlock was working perfectly with Nova Launcher on Lollipop. Thank you and also for your wonderful launcher.  Full Review  ", "Review 6": " A Must Have Launcher I absolutely love this launcher. It's a must have for all of my devices. I would like to eventually see some new features and designs. After a while, you do run out of ways to change the settings. Being able to install as many icon packs as you want is great for changing the look though. I think integration for new settings and abilities would be great though. Some of the things the launcher does needs to be polished up but over all it is the BEST launcher on the Play Store.  Full Review  ", "Review 7": " Loving it! Better than oneplus launcher! This has really made things so much easier. When I used to use the OnePlus launcher that came with my OPT, it would automatically delete my gadgets from the home screen, as it decided I clearly didn't need them when hard resetting. Real pain. I decided to try this and voila, no problems anymore \u263a Also, folder with many many icons in one small place, great. Generally love it. Nothing I dislike so far.

Any suggestions?  Full Review  ", "Review 9": " Puts all other launchers to shame Nova launcher has consistently outshined any stock Android launcher or any other third party launcher. I know everyone has their own preference, but I urge you, if you truly enjoy having your tech personally customized then Nova will not disappoint. I've used a ton of launchers over the years, and nothing ever compared to Nova. Very simple Ui, and yet the perfect blend of customization for a truly unique experience. I don't ever make purchases on applications, but I was more than happy to \"show my support\".

Good work devs, i like how the ui changes when I updates my phone :)  Full Review  ", "Review 12": " Brilliant ! Very customizable but simple to setup and use. Other apps seem bulky and complicated to customize but this app has got it just right. Faster, smoother and  far better than Jelly Bean's stock launcher.

Other than that, I would recommend.

At the time it was a necessity for the performance gains and battery saving it provided over the bundled Android launcher with my Galaxy Nexus and later with my Note 2. Now I use it for the excellent improvements in UI customizability, cool animations, and continued focus on a clean and non bloated / adware supported launcher like so many others out there. Really great job by the whole team, keep up the good work!  Full Review  ", "Review 15": " Alternate Home Screen with LOTS of Options I have enjoyed Google Now as my home screen but was looking for more customization. Nova met this need much more than all the others I tested. It's responsive and has many features. One item I would like to see is allow new names to start Google's voice search. This doesn't lower Nova from a 5 for value, speed and options.  Full Review  ", "Review 16": " Nice, simple, smooth and effective! I used Touchwiz but wasn't pleased that it isn't possible to get more rows and columns... untill now! This one rocks and it took over my screen layout from Touchwiz (position of buttons and widgets and all) and that made me very happy! Gestures are also very handy. I use double tap to open file manager, swipe up for camera,  etc. Definitely recommended!

However, in a time when we accept products that don't work, this product works as described. It has yet to crash once and very smooth. One suggestion to the programmers, an option for a blurred background when opening folders or the app drawer, would be awesome! Fantastic product overall!

After marshmallow update I have been experiencing problems though. Number one... After I wake the phone up, I see that the launcher is opening apps on it's own. I would make sure that I have no open apps before putting it to sleep so I know it's not user error.

While I absolutely adore all the personalization(too many options to list but I love them all), I couldn't help but revert back to TouchWiz on my s7 edge.

The unread badges is one of the best things about this launcher. Other launchers usually glitch or don't appear at all. This one is reliable plus customizability is endless with this launcher.

Even though I was awestruck at every level, the whole game only took me a few minutes to go through. Forgotten Shores doesn't require download, this us just disrespectful.  Full Review  ", "Review 20": " A Work of Art Monument Valley is no ordinary game.  It has beautiful music, a great story, calm gameplay, and still holds a true challenge and is still labeled as a puzzle, but feels like a game.  The artwork and design is created with love and a passion for sharing its beauty.   Overall, my favorite game by-far in the app store and one that I cannot stop playing.  Full Review  ", "Review 21": " Can't purchase forgotten shores This game is amazing in both depth and design and, although a bit short, totally worth the price. That said, I'm having issues purchasing forgotten shores. Whatever the type of payment I chose this type of payment is refused. Since I can purchase other products from the play store, I think this issue is specific to this expansion. I'll gladly rate this app 5 stars if this issue is resolved.  Full Review  ", "Review 22": " I seriously never play puzzle games But this is just something else. It's jaw-dropping in so many aspects. The visual style and atmosphere, the Escheresque geometrically impossible puzzles and the \"ah wow!\" factor of solving them. Everything about this game screams genius and unique.  Full Review  ", "Review 23": " Good, but not Worth it A very good concept executed in a fantastic fashion. Sadly it is currently way too expensive for what it's offering. $4 is good for 10 levels (1-2 hours of gameplay) which aren't challenging in the slightest, and then I am expected to pay even more for extra gameplay. It's a shame, this game would be an easy 5 star rating if it wasn't ridiculously short and waay overpriced.  Full Review  ", "Review 24": " Love It I played this game over and over and over, like dozens of times. I don't even know what I'm trying to achieve any more, beside enjoying the beautiful worlds all over again.

Totally want to continue playing on Forgotten Shores but I cannot purchase as all my method of payment are invalid for some reason. Slight disappointment that it's not more difficult and took me too short a time to complete. Still enjoyed it. See you soon, Ida.  Full Review  ", "Review 26": " Nice but short for the money to be paid. Fun to play, Nice implementation of isometric graphics in puzzle solving. Graphically simple but appealing. 10+8 Chapters. Though it is a bit disheartening that after buying the game you need to buy the pack if you want to play more for about Rs 100 which could be considered if the game had some replay value(which it clearly doesn't have).  Full Review  ", "Review 27": " Great game, far too short What gameplay there is feels smart and original and I love the design but it is far too short to be a pay for game.

Deceptively simple in many ways. Some challenges are fairly straightforward; others may have you thinking, \"But I can't get OVER there....\" Well, yes you can. Remember this is Escheresque. Very.

Tons of potential but there's still a lot of work to do. It was too short and far too easy for my taste but still pretty awesome. Well worth the 99\u00a2. Update. I played the expansion. The last 2 levels started to get interesting. Still not the puzzle I was looking for but I love the idea of playing with perspective and topology.

Absolutely love this delightful game. Can't wait to keep playing. Good job developers and artists!!  Full Review  ", "Review 32": " Too short and too easy I liked this game but there sure could have been more of it.

I tried to make the transaction through a giftcard on which I had plenty of credit left on but it denied that form of payment. I find this to be annoying especially since I was fully willing to purchase it, now that I have completed the original and idas dream I really have nothing left to do with the app. You just lost 1.99 :/  Full Review  ", "Review 38": " Relaxing and Thoughtful More of a high quality interactive short story than a puzzle, the beautifully designed graphics and ambient soundtrack are delightful to play with.

It is best suited for larger screens, darkened rooms, patient players, good processors and those who base gaming success on more than fastest times and points. It's challenging but not frustrating. I do find frequent references and symbols to a particilar mythology disconcerting though.  Full Review  ", "Review 23": " Great game I am on the epilogue at the moment. I think I'll be buying the sequel. This game kept me entertained for hours! The puzzles presented a moderate challenge which I enjoyed piecing together. I have never been great with riddles, puzzles, brainteasers, etc... However, with some effort and patience I made it through the levels, and without too much frustration at that. Beyond that, this game has a great atmosphere, from the graphics to the music to the story. It both intrigued and unsettled me. A great game!

I know I'm late to the game here (no pun intended), but this was so good I had to rate it. I rarely rate apps, games or otherwise.    This was just the right amount of challenging but not frustrating, was engaging, intriguing, looked great, music set the perfect tone.

I would say its worth the download.  Full Review  ", "Review 26": " Mind bending at its BEST!!!!! Absolutely AWESOME you guys! This is a puzzle game, and a half.

The objective is simple - make sets and sequences. Read the detailed rules of how to play rummy here. Beware - it's addictive! -- 13 Card Points Rummy Rules --Points Rummy is a 2 to 5 player game played with 2 or more packs of 53 cards each (including one printed joker per pack).Players play for points which have a pre-decided cost.Each player brings a minimum amount to the table.A toss decides who makes the first move.Each player is dealt 13 cards randomly.The first card from the pack is placed in the open deck and the game begins.Remaining cards are face-down in the closed deck slot.A joker card is randomly selected at the beginning of each game.Printed Joker : In case a printed joker is selected as joker for a game, then you can also use Ace card of any suit as a joker in your sets and / or sequences.Objective : Arrange all 13 cards in-hand in sequences and/or sets.Each player takes turns to pick/discard a card from closed/open deck to complete sets and/or sequences.You can use one or more jokers to complete your sets and/or sequences.When you're done, tap on the card to discard and tap FINISH. To declare, the player must show the cards by grouping them in sets/sequences and clicking on 'Declare' button.COMPULSORY : To finish the game, you must declare at least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence.CAUTION : With two decks, you cannot use the same card twice in a set for instance 7 \u2660 7 \u2660 7 \u2665 is not a valid set.-- Rummy Tips and Tricks --Want to sharpen your Rummy skills? Practice our clever tips and tricks and you can become a Rummy pro.Play Smart, Win Smart!First things first: A Pure Sequence is your lifeline, so get that done first. This ensures you don't get the sum of all points of all cards in your hand lest your opponent declares at any time.Keep a close watch on your opponent's playing. Keep a keen track of cards your opponent picks or discards from the Open deck or Hand so that you know which cards to hoard and what to discard. Cards close to the ones being discarded or kept are the ones.Discarding high point cards like hot potatoes could save your game! Hoarding high point cards like Ace, King, Queen or Jack and waiting to form Sets and/or Sequences with them can increase your points burden lest your opponent declares before you.A Sequence (Pure or with a Joker) can have 4 cards. Most people think a Sequence cannot have more than 3 cards which is simply not true.See? You are already getting ahead, now make use of this and enjoy your ULTIMATE RUMMY EXPERIENCE!", "Review 0": " Connection Problem Graphics and effects are best...

Not having these features makes the app feel a little dated in a way seeing as most stock android players can either support chromecast or have a play to feature. Other than that its a great app would highly recommend to anyone  Full Review  ", "Review 1": " Top Quality Audio Player Best audio player on Android, even the best between other Paid audio player too.. it also support with my custom ROM i've used which include Dolby and SRS Effect and both of them enabled on this Equalizer. So the output was very loud and clear enough with powerfull Bass and wideness of Surround combined by Stereo X with Dolby Effects. Never regret 4 bucks i've spent. Gr8 Job!!  Full Review  ", "Review 2": " Amazing - Music Player I have used many different  music players on both Android and IOS. I have never seen a match for Poweramp. It may not have amazing animations like the IOS stock music player but it does what a Music player should. It plays music, as well as boasts (what I think is) the best custom equalizer on any mobile platform, and at five dollars it really is the best money I have ever spent. If anyone cares more about the look of a music player than the sound than they should be using IOS.  Full Review  ", "Review 3": " The Only Player for Android 4.0+ I had to literally research to find a player that still reads off of an SD card. The default music applications will only read off of the phone itself (Galaxy S2/S3 etc), so this app was a Godsend! Now the 15 gigs of music I have can actually be listened to! Not only that but the widgets are very customizable and perfect for sleek design. You guys made the perfect audio playet for Android! Thank you so much!  Full Review  ", "Review 4": " Features! Ton of 'em! This is the most complete and polished audio player there is. No regrets buying it. Now, the nitpicking. I love how Poweramp finds high quality album art, which really makes the player screen come to life. But I factory reset and flash my phone constantly which makes the downloaded album art dissappear. I would love to have a way to embed the downloaded album art directly into the id3 tag, or however it's called. Much thanks to the devs for an already great app.  Full Review  ", "Review 5": " So far so good.  Some ideas... I have used this player for a few years now and have not been able to find a replacement.  To stay ahead of the game this app could use cloud service connectivity to dropbox, skydrive, etc.  And what would really set it apart would be a voice command search-n-play feature. I would then give it two- Five Star ratings for a total of Ten.  Full Review  ", "Review 6": " Easiest to use, smoothest sound quality includes a ten band eq section that let's you shape the sound to your liking and works super with high quality ear buds. This is better than any other music player bar none. Just increase the audio buffer size and you can throw any extreme eq setting at it with any major sound glitches. Even with out beats I highly recommend power amp for its sound quality and customization! 10 stars is what I really want to give!

It just made the music sound like the bands intended them to sound like. I tried other players, being stubborn about paying for an app, and quickly realized, you will NOT find better! Thank you for such an amazing app, I will recommend to all friends! Update: Been using this app for almost two years now, best purchase ever!

Not just the modern ones, finds the vintage hard to find ones too.  I'm sold on this app and delighted that I came across it while looking for ID3 tag editors. Great at retrieving lyrics instantaneously with free plugin as well. Superb sound.  1 suggestion would be to add more sound effect options; depth reverberation etc...  GREAT JOB GUYS !  Full Review  ", "Review 9": " Good but not great...yet Here are some things that could make this music player better: 1. Let's start with an exit button, all apps should have one! 2. On the artist section there should be an option for picture cover for each artist instead of just a dull list. 3. The UI needs to be streamlined to be more intuitive and is in need of a new modern design.  Aside from that this music player is without a doubt amongst the best in overall performance, no complaints there.  Full Review  ", "Review 10": " The best music player on planet earth!! Went through a lot of hassle to buy this app. Had to get a new Idea Sim just to be able to pay for this app, here in India. Google Play Store only accepts credit cards and certain debit cards. If not for the problems in making payments, we would be buying a lot more apps in India. Coming to the app, it is amazing how the beta version 3.0 has improved.

I have some pretty racy album art pics that I do not like on my lock screen. The band Die Antwoord, for example, has very racy nearly nude pics. One of the album art pics depict a woman on all fours with four breasts being milked by a machine. Doesn't bother me but I don't feel these types of images are work appropriate.

The only improvements that I could think of would be to make the shuffle feature more random. It seems like the music is shuffled in the same order every time you use the player. It would also be nice to prevent playing songs that have already played even though you have closed the music player once.

Poweramp is awesome and the best music app I've had and tried all the top ones from ever list. I don't know what else to say honestly. 4 Stars lacking one because of their latest update is the best thing ever minus one small thing. Changing songs on the Lock Screen is the best!!!

{"Name": "Greenify (Donation Package)", "Description": "This is just a donation package which activates some experimental features (require ROOT) in the Greenify (free) app. Enable features from the main menu of Greenify.=== 7 Days Refund Guarantee ===Don't worry about the 15 minutes window, just relax and explore all the features. Refund requested in \"Orders\" of Google Play (or Google Wallet) within 7 days is guaranteed. (may take days to manually process). REQUESTS BY EMAIL WILL BE IGNORED.=== Disclaimer ===Some of these experimental features are still in early stage. They may not work on all devices & ROMs. They are included only for advanced users with sufficient knowledge about what they really mean and how to correctly use them. These features may crash your apps, or even brick your phone in the extreme cases. I will try my best to avoid those situations, but I don't take responsibility about the possible consequences. For your safety, please do a NANDroid backup before activating these features.It is safe to purchase and install, since nothing is affected until any of the experimental features is enabled explicitly.=== Experimental Features ===\u25c6 Boost mode (requires Xposed)Android framework is patched to allow Greenify to perform hibernation and other operations without the slow root routine. Besides, Boost mode also improves compatibility of many features in Greenify.\u25c6 Allow (most) system apps to be greenified in GreenifyBeware, most system apps are critical to the basic functionality of your device, once greenified, you may lose some part of usability. If something bad happens, degreenify the system apps you recently greenified and reboot, or deactivate this experimental features of Greenify and reboot.\u25c6 Allow GCM push message to wake hibernated apps (requires Xposed)Google service framework is patched to allow the GCM (Google Cloud Message, a.k.a. C2DM) broadcast to wake the hibernated apps, thus you can greenify some apps without losing the ability to receive push message.Attention: Not all apps use GCM as push mechanism, some apps create their own connection for push in background service, thus can't benefit from this patch and their push messages can never survive hibernation. Please DO NOT ask for that, it's just a \"mission impossible\" in practice. Instead, ask their developer to adopt the more RAM-and-battery-friendly GCM push.\u25c6 Keep Notifications after HibernationAndroid framework is patched to keep notifications from being removed when application hibernates.\u25c6 Wake-up Tracker (requires Xposed)Android framework is patched to track which app implicitly woke your hibernated apps. You can decide whether to cut-off the wake-up path to avoid further wake-ups.\u25c6 Block App State Abuse. (requires Xposed)Block the the abuse (via a vulnerability of Android up to 4.2) used by some apps to keep themselves from being killed by Android. This abuse leads to undesired apps \"Not Hibernating\" due to false \"Perceptible\" state in Greenify.PS: For Android 4.3+, this can also remove the annoying permanent notification from some apps, which was hidden in pre-4.3 system.=== Xposed Installation ===1. Download and install Xposed installer: http://goo.gl/CKTWXZ2. Install the \u201cFramework\" in the \"Xposed Installer\" and activate \"Greenify\" in \"Modules\".3. Reboot=== Why do I need to install another framework for some features to work? ===Since these experimental features all need OS level patches, traditionally they can only be applied with ROM modding, which is highly device-specific and ROM-exclusive. Xposed framework is a new hope to do finer grained tiny patches in a ROM-independent way. Thanks to Xposed framework, you can enjoy these experimental features of Greenify without replacing your ROM.=== Feedback and further discussion ===Visit the community: http://goo.gl/MoszF or XDA forum: http://goo.gl/ZuLDnE", "Review 0": " Superb, Xposed module #1 All features working fine, inc system apps hibernation.

Love this game, great graffics and lots to keep you entertained! However it is very difficult to keep up with the city's expansion. I have lots of community buildings left half built as I do not have the materials or the cash to finish them! Maybe you have to play A LOT to get these things.. So you kind of get stuck when you progress quickly through the levels, but can't populate the city! Quicker trains would be such a help though!  Full Review  ", "Review 1": " Awesome  game Best game I ever downloaded for free. Never have to spend a penny and still be able to progress through the levels. Always plenty to do, and the higher the levels the more to do. If I had one gripe it would be the storage issue. I've worked it from every end from leaving crops in the field till I need them to,leaving my production shelves just shy of full to alleviate  the issue but it still is the toughest part of the game.  Full Review  ", "Review 2": " Still loving this game Updated review: I've been playing Township for six months and it's about the only one I play. It has so much to do, so much customization and the graphics are fantastically cute. Only thing I would change is the time decrease you get for trains when you use ingots. Being my trains still take 3 1/2 to 4 hours, I don't feel like the percentages are taking much time off. This game is more than worth playing and buying in-app purchases for.

I kinda pretty like it. Way different from others. Just one thing.. so hard to earn dollars.. is there any cheats for that? \ud83d\ude02 But overall..  WOW just WOW  \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udcaa\u270c\u270c\ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f  Full Review  ", "Review 4": " Great game. But..... I love the game it is amazing the way you can build your own buildings and feel as if your actually in charge of something. It would be better if the barn could never become full, I know it makes it more challenging and real. But it really annoying me every time I go to harvest crops it says it is full. You could fix a glitch where when your trains get to your township they don't just sit around after you filled them up. But anyway love the game update it a little more so you can make  house for yourself and make a customised building. Thank you  Full Review  ", "Review 5": " More details I want to restart this game over bc i dont like how I build it. But I know now way I want it to be but it's to hard to move stuff around without selling everything and start from begin is a lot easier how would I do that.  And two make more things look more real like a real town make the water move in tanks and fish u can see more clear. Just add more details to this game to make it more fun  Full Review  ", "Review 6": " Best interactive game I've played I love this game and can't put it down. The only thing that I don't like is how much everything costs.  Land plots and buildings. I can't keep up with expansion of my city.  Not fair.  That's why I do not give five stars. You should make it easier for us poor people to play.  Aside from that,  the graphics are amazing and i actually lose myself in my little neighborhood that i have created down by the water. I have houses for me and all my grown children.  It sounds silly,  but its so fun.  Great game.  Full Review  ", "Review 7": " Crush Aswme... Dis game is fo me.. I want to suggest developer plz dont allow to sell directly from BARN DT will make people think twice before producing sumthng.

I think this change will make the game more interesting  Full Review  ", "Review 8": " Make friends around the world! Very interesting & interactive with beautiful graphics.  Could stay here for hours & not realize much time has passed, because YOU \"are a part\" of the game. FUN & relaxing. Best farm game, easy to learn!  I like the challenges that it brings. Join a co-op, make friends around the world/texting them, doing fun tasks for the Regatta. Planting gardens, baking goods, helping friends, selling to the townsfolk, work the mine, make your own money, plus so much more. Keeps you on your toes!  Full Review  ", "Review 9": " I'm upping my rating. If you want developers that put time and effort into their apps and actually have great customer service; plus have provided an excellent, challenging, and fun game, then download and enjoy. The game is not just the same mundane  objectives over and over. One thing though, it is VERY TIME CONSUMING \ud83d\ude18  Full Review  ", "Review 10": " Easily Earned Rewards You are actually able to earn diamonds, dollars and coins. In most games it's nearly impossible to earn things needed to grow your town or complete tasks, but in this game you can earn anything and everything and even ask for help as well as help others. Everything is achievable and nothings too easy!!! Not to mention, time for growing plants and building materials is manageable and not a ridiculous wait. Great game and tons of fun!!  Full Review  ", "Review 11": " BEST GAME EVER I can't stop playing! I enjoy the rewards and the use of game cash is reasonable. Goals and achievements are fair. And I love that I get to be part of a co op that helps me when i need it. Great game and every update has not disappointed me. I honestly can't fault it. I just dislike the helicopter challenges that need gold or silver or platinum but it's not a big deal  Full Review  ", "Review 12": " Missing Money but still Addicted I absolutely love this game. However, I purchased the special value for 11.99 including a ship and 500 township  cash on the 27th and it vanished from my account without me getting to spend it.  I did call Google and they refunded it back to my account (Thank you Google). I will repurchase the special value deal in hopes that all of my cash stays in my account. I love the game and would definitely recommend it.  Full Review  ", "Review 13": " Fun game This is a fun Sim/farm type game. I enjoy changing my city around and thinking of new layouts. The messaging system could use some work and occasionally certain items are hard to pick up depending on what's next to it. Would be nice to allow more customization with the player name and avatar. Battery drain can be an issue. Overall, I think it's a good solid game but a little rough around the edges.  Full Review  ", "Review 14": " Great game keep coming back to it to it to harvest and sow Would give 5 star if building materials like white panes would come quicker. Trains take too long to get back. Love the fact that you can move buildings around to make it flow better and there are no petty rules like every house should have a road. I visit several times a day to keep on top of the chores. Fabulous detailed graphics love the little figures but would like to see more cats and dogs and maybe some wildlife?  Full Review  ", "Review 15": " Love! The detail that went into this game is astounding! Didn't realize just how many little details there are until a few days after playing. It's incredible. The fact that you can build a farm, town, and a zoo is also a pretty amazing aspect of this game. 3 in 1, lots to do, and never bored. Recommend this game to any who might be thinking of downloading. It's Great!  Full Review  ", "Review 16": " One of the best games I've played so far! Great game. Lots to keep you busy plus different side games to aim for.  Always something to do .  Brilliant visual graphics, keep finding new characters wandering around.  Fantastic themes e.g Halloween.  Can't wait to seed Santa! Only thing I would like to see is the option to exchange coins for cash as you can get tempted to spend but don't have to to enjoy the game,  just takes longer to progress.  Definately One of my favourite games of all time!  Full Review  ", "Review 17": " Still loving it..best game ever!! Getting hooked!lol!

Full Review  ", "Review 18": " Fun and addictive This is a super fun and addictive little game and a great way to pass the time if you're waiting for something. The only reason I have 4 stars is the cost of items, I don't mind spending a little cash on a game I enjoy from time to time, however, 128 game cash to finish one building is ridiculous when 50 game cash costs $2 real money, that's basically $4.5 per building and that's only the cheaper ones. Maybe if they looked at reducing the cost to complete things I'll change my rating!

This game is awesome the only thing I'd change is it would be nice if when you find a treasure chest it wasn't locked all of the time and the market didn't always require $12 to special order items for the day but since you do have to pay perhaps a longer time frame and shorter breaks or after first 3 items a break?  Besides these things.....  love, love, LOVE this game  Full Review  ", "Review 21": "  I love the deco part of this game. It is easy to change and doesn't  cost to change the land. Waiting for shovels is a hard part, to buy land to add the necessary  buildings to move forward.  Not enough tools need to mine as well. Hope it gets better as I progress farther in the game.
